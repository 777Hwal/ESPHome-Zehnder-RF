# ESPHome-Zehnder-RF
Hans van der Wal / 28-11-2025
The idea to remote control the ComfortAir 400 E RF is from others, See below 
Because this wasn't working (FanState.h) didn't exist any more I had to make some changes. 
Without the knownledge to do this properly on Github, I created my own repositry

Thanks to :
Print to connect ESP32 & nRF905 comes from [JoooostB/Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/joooostb/zehnder-comfoair-home-assistant-controller/?pt=ac_prod_search)
