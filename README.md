The idea to remote control the ComfortAir 400 E RF is not mine
Thanks to :
Print to connect ESP32 & nRF905 nice comes from https://www.tindie.com/products/joooostb/zehnder-comfoair-home-assistant-controller/?pt=ac_prod_search
Original source code I copied from: https://github.com/drkx/ESPHome-Zehnder-RF (thanks)
Because this wasn't working (FanState.h) didn't exist any more I had to make some changes. 
Without the knownledge to do this properly on Github, I created my own repositry
